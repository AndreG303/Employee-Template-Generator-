# Employee-Template-Generator
I have Built a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This is a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
